### Chrome Indic

A small chrome extension inspired by [Project Naptha](http://projectnaptha.com/) and [Copyfish](https://github.com/A9T9/Copyfish) 

Chrome Indic uses [OCR Service](https://indic-ocr.github.io/ocrservice/) for OCR and transliteration service

Chrome Indic lets you select a rectangle of text in image and converts it to text. 

Download extension from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/indic-ocr/fejbddkpnmcnobmalnkflaljnlffblma)
